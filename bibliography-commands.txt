Must be entered in terminal to add bibliography to end of article

pdflatex janeausten
bibtex janeausten (x2? only if message about .aux file missing)
pdflatex janeausten
pdflatex janeausten


Need to run these commands only when bibliography file is changed. Can compile in RStudio if no changes to bibliography are present.
